freezing.css is a CSS microframework, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ikacc/joqd">Joqd</a> project, first Iranian front-end framework. freezing.css is not as large and complete as Joqd, but it still can help in creating fast websites! I actually wrote this micro-framework for my own projects, but I decided to make it public, because people out there may want to use a responsive micro-framework, and of course freezing.css is one of the best choices for a fast, simple and beautiful responsive website!
